# PHPSimplerTest, a.k.a. togos/simpler-test

Nearly drop-in replacement for PHPUnit, assuming you're only extending TestCase
and and calling ```assert{True,False,Equals,NotEquals,Null,NotNull}```
from ```testX``` methods.

Inherit from ```TOGoS_SimplerTest_TestCase```
and use ```phpsimplertest``` to run your tests from the command-line.
